    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Clay Mullins</h2>
    <p>I currently do not have a degree declared. I may pursue a degree in Cyber Security.
        As for hobbies, I like to build models; which are typically made from plastic, Lego, sheet metal (look up metal
        earth).
        My wife's name is Rachel, and we have 1 child.</p>
    <P>My current career is Information Technology for a school. I am not sure if I will change my career
        ,though I may use this opportunity to become more specialized in my career.
        I love BYU-I, it is a wonderful place to learn. I love that the faculty
        and all the other staff are here for the students.
        This is something that is quite special, compared to many other universities.
        For now, I am only perusing a few certificates related to I.T.
    </P>
    <p>Web design is a skill that is used quite often in I.T.
        Especially since many companies are moving to the cloud.
        I have noticed that I have several gaps in my knowledge related to web design that I want to fill.
        I take care of a few websites; It would be nice to know how to improve them.
    </p>
    <P>As for a quote, the one that has stuck with me to this day is in the general conference talk
        “Seek Ye the Kingdom of God” By President Gordon B. Hinckley 
        <blockquote cite="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/04/seek-ye-the-kingdom-of-god?lang=eng#p11">
            We all face choices in the course of our lives, some of them with a siren song of wealth and prosperity; others appear less promising. Somehow the Lord has watched over and guided my choices, although it was not always evident at the time. 
            There come to mind the words of Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken,” which concludes with these lines:            
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
            I took the one less traveled by, 
            And that has made all the difference. 
        </blockquote>
        As for a scripture: Matthew 5:14-16<br>
        Ye are the alight of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
        Neither do men light a acandle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
        Let your alight so shine before men, that they may see your good bworks, and cglorify your Father which is in heaven.
    </P>
