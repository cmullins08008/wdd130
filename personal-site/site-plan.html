        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <h4>Navigation</h4>
      <p>This will be where the user starts out. They will be given links for different recipes that they want to try. There should be an easy way to select what they want.</p>
      <h4>Selling the content</h4>
      <p>I will need to include pictures to entice people to click on recipes. I may have to make these recipes and see about getting good pictures of them.</p>
      <h4>Simple</h4>
      <p>The home page will more than likely be simple at this point. Since it will mainly be used for navigation, it should look nice, without distracting too much from the links. On the other hand, I may need to add pictures of the subpages here.  </p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <P>I am thinking that it might be good to add some background on why this site was created. Honestly, I really am not sure at this point what it should be or what it would look like. I am still thinking about what it could be. I am leaning toward giving a short background on my wife and I on who we are and why we have these recipes.</P>

      <h3>Bread</h3>
      <h4>Name</h4>
      <p>There will be the name of what is being cooked. These names will probably be basic with the goal of being self-explanatory.  I want people to immediately understand what they are cooking.</p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>little background will be given on this recipe, some uses, and things it pairs with.</p>
      <h4>Recipe</h4>
      <p>Ingredients will be listed, then detailed instructions will follow below this. Several wonderful tips will be added to ensure that the person who is following the recipe will be on the right path and will ensure that they have success. Each instruction itself will self self-explanatory.</p>
